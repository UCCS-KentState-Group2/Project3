	Working with our group is going very well. Even though we all live far away, we are in constant communication. Our work is being distributed well, Jake is in charge of all the UML diagrams and the high level designs. George takes care of the proper documentation and the database work, while I am in charge of the C# programming. No changes have occurred since our last meeting on Thursday.
